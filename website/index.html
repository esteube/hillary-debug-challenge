        I am originally from Los Angeles, California although I moved to Colorado when I was 25 years old.  I have been in Colorado for over 25 years, so I have now lived half my life, so to speak in 2 different places!  I have two grown children and a grandbaby on the way.  my daughter is Kayla who is 23 and is a college student at Maharishi University of Management and a son who is 21, Dylan who is the one expecting and is studying at Colorado Tech University.

        I have in the past been an avid skiier, although my newest hobby is road biking.  I also enjoy hiking in the Colorado mountains or the small walk around lakes near Arvada where I live.
    </p>
    <p>
        Camping is another adventure I enjoy pursuing and have dabbled with rock climbing starting with a course I took at Metro, which was one of the most fun classes I have taken.

        One of my biggest love is for playing Irish Traditional Fiddle and I often play in sessions in Boulder and Denver weekly.   
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a flair for the creative and thus it has been fun and a labor of love to design and rennovate three bathrooms in my home with stone travertine and marble tile with glass block and high end faucet fixtures.  I also designed a blown glass bowl as a sink for my master bathroom.

        For many of my adult years I have been a stay at home Mom raising my two beautiful children although for much of that time I had my hand in different entrepreneur endeavors.  I have had many jobs and some businesses:  Creative Memories, Massage Therapy, Data Base Coordinator at Lockheed Martin, Support Technical postitions at TRW, Skye Music Studios where I taught fiddle and sold violins and accessories.  Skye Bobcat Services where I owned my own bobcat serving residential homes for landscaping, Freelance Web Designer - Web Server Admin &amp; technical support and a Health and Wellness business.

        Last May of 2014 I graduated from Metro State University with a Bachelors of Science in Web Development and Business Intelligence with a Math and Music Minor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most recently I have finished a Web Design class at gschool in Denver with Matt Leach.  I loved it and learned many things with HTML, CSS and Web design in general including layout, some bootstrap with responsive layout, and we even touched on PHP for forms.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have an interest in learning more about PHP and how it can be applied to create custom made websites in WordPress.
